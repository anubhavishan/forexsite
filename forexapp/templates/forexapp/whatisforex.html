<h2>&nbsp;How Forex Trading Works</h2>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>🏦 a) The Market</h3>
    <p><strong>Decentralized & OTC (Over-the-Counter):</strong> No central exchange like stock markets.</p>
    <p><strong>Major Players:</strong> Central banks, commercial banks, hedge funds, corporations, and individual retail traders.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>🌐 b) Trading Pairs</h3>
    <p>Forex is traded in <strong>currency pairs</strong> like:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>EUR/USD</strong> – Euro vs US Dollar</li>
      <li><strong>GBP/JPY</strong> – British Pound vs Japanese Yen</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The first is the <strong>base currency</strong>, and the second is the <strong>quote currency</strong>.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> If EUR/USD = 1.1000, then 1 Euro = 1.10 USD.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>🔄 c) Types of Forex Markets</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Spot Market:</strong> Immediate exchange of currency.</li>
      <li><strong>Forward Market:</strong> Contracts to exchange in the future at agreed rates.</li>
      <li><strong>Futures Market:</strong> Standardized contracts traded on exchanges.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>📊 d) Price Movement</h3>
    <p>Currency prices are influenced by:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Interest rates</li>
      <li>Economic indicators (e.g., GDP, unemployment)</li>
      <li>Political stability</li>
      <li>News and market sentiment</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>📈 e) Trading Platforms</h3>
    <p>Traders use platforms like <strong>MetaTrader 4 (MT4)</strong> or <strong>MetaTrader 5 (MT5)</strong>.</p>
    <p>Brokers provide access to the forex market via these platforms.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>🔧 f) Leverage and Margin</h3>
    <p>Forex is often traded using <strong>leverage</strong> (borrowed money).</p>
    <p><strong>Margin</strong> is the deposit required to open a leveraged position.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> 100:1 leverage means you can control $10,000 with just $100.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Market Order:</strong> Buy/sell instantly at the current price.</li>
